# Customize toolbox 
Hello everyone, I am the author of the toolbox.

Thank you for seeing my open source library.

I will introduce you to how to use my software.

## Custom features

The purpose of releasing this software is to allow some authors who do not know how to code to customize the software library

You can put your prepared integration package in the tools folder . But you need to pay attention to the format .

**There is at least one exe or bat program in at least one subclass of a major category**

**If you haven't displayed your class, please note if you have defined it correctly**

It's like this`1 > 2/3 > 1.exe/2.bat `

In [beta 1.2.0](https://github.com/shuiyu0407/tolls/releases/tag/chuerl), we have added an ini file for testing.

He can't change anything now and will add more features later on.
